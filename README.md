# Airbnb Market Analysis Dashboard

### Tableau Dashboard developed by [Gaurab Kundu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurab-kundu/)

## Project Overview 📑

Imagine an AirBnB host who rents their property for customers, requires a detailed analysis of the revenue generated. A detailed analysis of this revenue is essential for several reasons. Not only does it help to track the performance of the property, but it also enables to make informed decisions to optimize rental strategy, offer competitive pricing, and enhance the overall guest experience. As a Data Analyst my task is to analyze the provided data, gain insights and present them to the stake-holder for making improved decisions on which location and the type of rental properties is best to invest in. 

## The Airbnb Data 📊
The dataset used for this project is a [2016 AirBnB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset) 

## Questions to Answer 🔍

This project was guided by four pivotal questions:

1. Did the total revenue experience growth or decline in the year 2016?
   
2. Which zip code emerged as the top performer in terms of bookings?
   
3. Which bedroom type proved to be the most favored among Airbnb guests?
   
4. When is the optimal period for Airbnb units to experience heightened activity?

## Key Findings 🗝️

- The total revenue surged from $1,012,412 to an impressive $2,110,350 in 2016.

- Zip code 98134 secured the top position for the most bookings, indicating its popularity among Airbnb guests.

- While 1-bedroom apartments attracted significant bookings, it's noteworthy that 6-bedroom accommodations commanded the highest price per bedroom. This suggests robust demand for 1-bedroom units, with potential for further exploration.

- The data showed that Airbnb units witnessed peak activity from April through December, providing valuable insights for hosts and property management.

## Final Thoughts 💭

Zip code 98134 is the best location to invest in a rental property & units with 1 bedrooms are the top performing assets.
