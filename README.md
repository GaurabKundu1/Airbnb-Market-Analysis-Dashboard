### Tableau Dashboard Developed by [Gaurab Kundu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurab-kundu/)

## Project Overview üìë

In this project, we envision an Airbnb host seeking to enhance their revenue and property management strategy. To achieve this, a comprehensive analysis of revenue data becomes imperative. Such an analysis not only enables property performance tracking but also facilitates data-driven decisions for pricing optimization, competitive positioning, and overall guest satisfaction. As a Data Analyst, my role is to explore the provided dataset, extract valuable insights, and present them to stakeholders, empowering them to make informed decisions on property investments.

## The Airbnb Data üìä
This project utilizes a dataset from the year 2016, sourced from [Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset) 

## Questions to Answer üîç

The project is driven by four key questions:

1. Did the total revenue experience growth or decline in 2016?
   
2. Which zip code emerged as the top performer in terms of bookings?
   
3. Which bedroom type proved to be the most favored among Airbnb guests?
   
4. When is the optimal period for Airbnb units to experience heightened activity?

## The Dashboard üìà

Our interactive dashboard provides a visual representation of the data and its insights.

## Key Findings üóùÔ∏è

- Total Revenue Growth: The total revenue soared from $1,012,412 to an impressive $2,110,350 in 2016, indicating substantial growth in the Airbnb business.

- Top-Performing Zip Code: Zip code 98134 emerged as the leader in bookings, underlining its popularity among Airbnb guests. This information can guide future investment decisions.

- Preferred Bedroom Type: While 1-bedroom apartments attracted a significant number of bookings, it's noteworthy that 6-bedroom accommodations commanded the highest price per bedroom. This suggests robust demand for 1-bedroom units and potential for further exploration in this area.

- Optimal Booking Period: Our data analysis revealed that Airbnb units experienced peak activity from April through December. This insight is valuable for hosts and property management, helping them plan for increased activity during these months.

## Final Thoughts üí≠

In conclusion, the data strongly suggests that Zip code 98134 is an ideal location for investment in rental properties. Additionally, units with 1 bedroom stand out as the top-performing assets, showcasing their desirability among Airbnb guests. These findings provide a clear path for property investors to make informed decisions and optimize their rental strategies.
