# Airbnb-Market-Analysis-Dashboard

### Tableau Dashboard developed by [Gaurab Kundu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurab-kundu/)

## Project Overview

Imagine an AirBnB host who rents their property for customers, requires a detailed analysis of the revenue generated. A detailed analysis of this revenue is essential for several reasons. Not only does it help to track the performance of the property, but it also enables to make informed decisions to optimize rental strategy, offer competitive pricing, and enhance the overall guest experience. As a Data Analyst my task is to analyze the provided data, gain insights and present them to the stake-holder for making improved decisions on which location is best to invest in rental properties. 

## The Airbnb Data
The dataset used for this project is a [2016 AirBnB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset) 

## Questions to Answer

This project was guided by four pivotal questions:

1. Did the total revenue experience growth or decline in the year 2016?
2. Which zip code emerged as the top performer in terms of bookings?
3. Which bedroom type proved to be the most favored among Airbnb guests?
4. When is the optimal period for Airbnb units to experience heightened activity?
